# AutoDad

This was my first Android app.  It's pretty dumb; it was just a way for
me to try out Android.

The target audience for this is my kids, so that they will always have
easy access to the sort of guidance I would give even when I'm not there
for them.

### TO CHECK OUT THE CODE

In Android Studio 3.1.3:

1. File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> GitHub

2. Clone Repository:
   - Repository URL: https://github.com/kuhrusty/AutoDad.git
   - Parent Directory: (whatever you want; probably
     /home/.../AndroidStudioProjects)
   - Directory Name: (whatever you want; probably AutoDad)

That should check the stuff out and start a Gradle build.  (I get a
couple of errors about missing .iml files; I ignored them--I said to
*not* remove the modules it was talking about--and things seem to build
& run correctly.)

### TO BUILD & RUN IT

In Android Studio, there may be a rectangular button in the toolbar
below the menu bar which says "app" and which has a green or gray
triangle to the right of it; if you click on that triangle, you might
get a window which lets you choose between your connected device, or an
emulated device (that is, running on a virtual/pretend phone in Android
Studio, not your real phone).  If your phone doesn't show up in that
window, something is wrong.  Choose your phone (plugged in as a USB
device, connected as a camera or a media device... probably camera) and
wait for the "Ask AutoDad 1.0!" screen to show up.
